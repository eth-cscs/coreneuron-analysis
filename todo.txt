Add section at introduction where I describe the plan to understand the data structure
    - how this drives data structure and parallelization approach.

Future steps section
    - plan for how to start porting
        - isolate computational engine with serialization of input and output
        - take the same approach that was applied to the Dycore
            - serialization of each step, so that it porting can go from kernel to kernel

Clean up maths/algorithm section
    + move details to appendix
    + expand bullet points
    + note that the numbering scheme illustrated is one possible scheme
        + the main point is that the parent_index[i] < i
