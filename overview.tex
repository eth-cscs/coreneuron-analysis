The code in its current form is a mixture of C and C++.

It must be noted that the code base is currently very challenging to understand and benchmark. It is derived directly from the Bluron/Neuron code base, which has grown organically over more than 20 years. There are very many opportunities to simplify and improve the code using modern programming languages and development techniqies.

To use both CPUs and accelerators (e.g. GPU and MIC) effectively, parts of the code will have to be refactored or rewritten. The main challenge in refactoring the code is not the complexity of the algorithms, it is the difficulty of understanding the current code. Developing documentation of the algorithms as they are currently implemented is an essential first step.

From early work with the code base, the majority of wall time for the example circuits release for the PCP is spent in a relatively small set of code: the \lst{nrnoc} solver implementation, and the mechanisms defined in \lst{/mecb/cfiles}. Improving performance, portability and maintainability will benefit from working on the core computational API.

An aim of this report is as a first attempt at describing the algorithms clearly, to make it possible to reason about how them without getting distracted by implementation details. To assist in this, many of the algorithms are presented in a pseudo-language similar to \emph{Julia}\footnote{See the website: \file{julialang.org}}, which should be familiar to users familiar with \emph{Matlab}.

\subsection{Code Issues}
%-------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the anti-patterns that make understanding the code difficult are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        There are many global variables. Static symbols are used for scoping within a translation units, which makes understanding where variables are defined and used challenging.
    \item
        The use of preprocessor \lst{#define} makes the code very difficult to reason about. Many variable names are redefined, which obscures the meaning of the code. There are also many ``magic numbers'' that are defined in separate translation units.
    \item
        The C++ code uses \lst{new} and \lst{delete} keywords, sometimes forgetting to delete. Should use static arrays or STL containers depending on needs.
    \item
        Complicated data structures that make it very difficult for both humans and compilers to reason about the code. These are a hang over from the original, more complicated, Neuron code from which \neuron is derived. Besides lack of clarity, this complexity means that there are lost opportunities for optimization by the compiler.
    \item
        Poor (non-existant in places) comments, and poor naming of variables.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Code Layout}
%-------------------------------------------------------------
The source code is packaged in a file \lst{CoreBluron.tar.gz}, which has the directory structure in \fig{fig:DirectoryStructure}.
In terms of time to solution, functions defined in \lst{mech/cfiles} dominate. These are called from the solver routines in \lst{nrnoc}, which implements the core computation, and is the focus of the analysis here.

\subsection{Building}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The code was built on Cray XC-30 system Piz Daint at CSCS with minimal fuss using the GNU toolchain.
The Cray compiler toolchain had problems that are not insurmountable, but they would require a lot of tinkering with the \emph{Buildyard}\footnote{\file{github.com/Eyescale/Buildyard}} build tool used by \neuron.

The Buildyard uses cmake, with a custom set of cmake modules developed by BBP (the BuildYard modules). Many of these modules are not required by \neuron, and configuration can be sped up significantly by removing them (for example the C++11 tests). The cmake configuration attempts to determine the version of the Cray compiler by passing a flag that the compiler doesn't recognise, causing the configuration to exit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Datasets}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are two data sets provided with the PCP benchmark code:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TEST1\_CACHE} A network small enough to fit into Cache of one rack of BG/Q. Has size of 2.5G on disk.
    \item \textbf{TEST2\_DRAM} A much larger network (size 4.5T on disk), that fits in DRAM of one rack of BG/Q.
\end{itemize}
